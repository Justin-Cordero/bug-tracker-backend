# Bug-Tracker Backend

This is the backend for [Bug-Tracker](https://github.com/Justin-Cordero/bug-tracker). This REST API was built with Python using the Django REST Framework. The relational database used to store data was PostgreSQL. JSON Web Tokens were also implemented to support user authentication and authorization.

## Database Schema

## Hosting

This REST API, along with the database, are hosted on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) for its ease of setup and free tier.
